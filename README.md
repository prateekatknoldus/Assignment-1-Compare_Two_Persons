# Assignment 1 For Performing Comparison Between Two Persons

In this Assignment, I have created a class named Person and mixed it with Ordered trait. For performing comparison between two persons i have overrided the compare method of Ordered trait in Person class. In this way the overrided compare method will be called when we compare one person to another person.

# For example:
Input: personOne = new Person("Prateek", 21) and personTwo = new Person("Prateek", 25)
and if we check: personOne < personTwo
Output: true
